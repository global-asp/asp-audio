# African Storybook Project Audio
This is a repository of open-licensed storybook audio from the [African Storybook Project](http://africanstorybook.org/).

## Format

The stories have been recorded by volunteers and are provided in several different formats to facilitate ease of use in other projects.

Full audio of each story is available in mp3 and ogg format in the root of each subdirectory.

In addition, pre-split tracks in both mp3 and ogg format can be found in `mp3` and `ogg` folders for each story. Each track represents one page of the storybook.
