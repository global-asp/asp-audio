# African Storybook Project Audio
This is a repository of open-licensed storybook audio from the [African Storybook Project](http://africanstorybook.org/).

## Languages

Each subfolder in the main directory contains recordings for a different language, identified by its ISO 639-1/3 code (e.g. `fr` for French, `lg` for Luganda).

A full list of languages covered by this repository and their ISO 639-1/3 codes can be found [here](https://github.com/global-asp/asp-source#languages).

## Format

The stories have been recorded by volunteers and are provided in several different formats to facilitate ease of use in other projects.

Full audio of each story is available in mp3 and ogg format in the root of each subdirectory.

In addition, pre-split tracks in both mp3 and ogg format can be found in `mp3` and `ogg` folders for each story. Each track represents one page of the storybook.

## Usage

The audio in this repository has been used in a number of ways. Currently, all recordings are automatically paired with corresponding text and images to create audio slideshows for the Global African Storybook Project. You can listen to and read along with these stories [here](http://global-asp.github.io/audio/asp/).
